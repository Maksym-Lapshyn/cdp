1) Task1_DeletingScript.sql Don't declare temporary tables like @routesToDelete, put full select queries instead of  IN (SELECT * FROM @routesToDelete)
+ 2) Task1_DeletingScript.sql what is BEGIN TRANSACTION second, without committing or rolling back?
+ 3) Task 2, you need to implement it using at least two differen ways it will give you +2 

Good job.
