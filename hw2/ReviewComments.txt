1) Task1_CreateProcedures.sql Add ability to modify stored procedure (this script should be rerunable)!
2) Task2_DeleteQueries.sql /*SECOND QUERY*/ does not work - wrong logic. Should work when 3 trucks have same Registration number, should work when there are more than one truck with dulicated Registration number.
For example insert

USE Shipment_ML;

INSERT INTO dbo.Truck (
	BrandName,
	RegistrationNumber,
    Payload,
	FuelConsumption,
	Volume)
VALUES (
	'BOGDAN',
	'1ABC241',	
	17500,
	20,
	95
);
and /*SECOND QUERY*/ will not work correctly

3) In all scripts for HM 2 and later use AS syntax - it's easy to read, Example FROM @filterTable AS f instead of FROM @filterTable f; If you saw some convention to don't use AS - we can discuss it.
4) Task3_CreateXMLProcedure.sql There are 70 % of duplication between first and second implementation of stored procedures, try use COALESCE to concatenate filters https://stackoverflow.com/questions/194852/how-to-concatenate-text-from-multiple-rows-into-a-single-text-string-in-sql-serv
5) Task3_CreateXMLProcedure.sql SELECT fieldName = Node.Data.value( you can write just Data.value( (without Node)
 Node - is table, Data - is column - if person who reads your code does not know XMLNodes syntax - how he can understand it? Give meaningful names for Node and Data
